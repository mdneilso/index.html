I feel that the one that was best for hosting articles so far was the codepen csis page. While the other ones seemed easier
  for getting links to pages sorted, wordpen gave a way to more clearly implement things that I wanted done outside of my
  currently limited knowledge of html writing. In the future, I may have a different opinion after I have learned more, but
  for now wordpen was much easier to implement than the other available options for articles.
